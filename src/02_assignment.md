# Assignment

Assignment of a value to a symbol, a variable, is incredibly useful.
It allows one to save the result of a complicated expression, so that
it can be used later without computing again. It lets one name structures
so that they can be used again and again.

In Volpe, assignment is done with the equals `=` operator.
A value on the right is assigned to the variable or symbol on the left.

Here are some examples:

```volpe
# a is assigned the value 5
a = 5

# b is assigned the value 3.14
b = 3.14

# c is assigned the result of
# the expression -(2 - 4) * 8,
# therefore c becomes 16.
c = -(2 - 3) * 8
```
