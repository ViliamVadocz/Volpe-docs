# Expressions and Types

Other languages differentiate between statements and expressions.
Statements do things, while expressions have a value. In Volpe,
everything is an expression; even assignment!

Most statement-like expressions evaluate to the boolean value true.
This will come up later in [Assertions](./05a_assertions.md).

The full list of Volpe types is found below:

- Booleans (1 bit)
- Integers (32 bit)
- Floating Point Numbers (32 bit)
- Tuples
